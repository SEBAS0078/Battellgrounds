      <h4>
        Battellgrounds is New Battell’s first building-wide competition. Floors earn points
        through monthly events, participation, and keeping common spaces clean. At the end
        of the year, the winning floor takes home the <strong>New Battell Cup</strong> and an
        extra budget for a celebration.

<h2>How are points calculated?</h2>
<div>
  <div class="event-explanation">
    <p>
      Points for monthly events are divided into two categories: 
      <strong>Participation</strong> and <strong>Competition Results</strong>.
    </p>

    <h4>Participation</h4>
    <p>
      Each floor earns a participation score based on the percentage of its residents
      who attend the event. The higher the percentage, the better your floor’s 
      participation score.
    </p>

<h4>Competition Results</h4>
<p>
  Additional points are awarded based on floor placements in traditional events with clear rankings:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>1st Place: <strong>200 points</strong></li>
  <li>2nd Place: <strong>100 points</strong></li>
  <li>3rd Place: <strong>60 points</strong></li>
  <li>4th Place: <strong>40 points</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>
  Some events may not have clear placements (for example, participation-based activities, creative submissions, or collaborative events). In those cases, point values may be assigned differently at the discretion of the organizers. 
</p>
<p>
  If multiple floors tie for a placement, the corresponding points for that placement are divided equally among the tied floors.
